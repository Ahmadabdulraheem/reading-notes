## HTML text tags
>When creating a web page, you add tags
known as *markup* to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.
In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that
appears on your pages. You will learn about:
* Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs, examples:

  -heading < h >
  -paragraph < p >
  -break < br/ > , < hr/ >
* Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on.  
  - < strong >
  - < em >
  - Quotations < blackquote > , < q >
  - abbreviations  < abbr >
  - < address >

## Introducing CSS
>CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS
mostly involves learning the different properties you can use.
So this chapter will:
* Introduce you to how CSS works
* Teach you how to write CSS rules
* Show you how CSS rules apply to HTML pages
The remaining chapters in this section will look at all of the
various CSS properties you can use.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
>**STATEMENTS**
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

1. comments //
2. Data types: 
  + numeric  
  + boolean 
  + string
3. Arrays: An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

## Decisions and Loops
>Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web
page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often
rely upon the following three concepts:
1. **EVALUATIONS**
You can analyze values in
your scripts to determine
whether or note they
match expected results.
9 DECISIONS & LOOPS
2. **DECISIONS**
Using the results of
evaluations, you can
decide which path your
script should go down.
3. **LOOPS**
There are also many
occasions where you will
want to perform the same
set of steps repeatedly.
