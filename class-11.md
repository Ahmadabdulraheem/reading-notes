## Images
Controlling sizes of images in CSS
You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box. 
`img.large {
width: 500px;
height: 500px;}`.

* **Aligning images** using CSS
1. The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.
 
* **Centering images** using CSS
1. On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

* The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element.
`body {
background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");}`

`background-repeat
background-attachment`
