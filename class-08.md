# CSS Layout

>Controlling the he position of elements creating site layouts designing for different sized screens

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

* If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

**positioning schemes:**
|<>|scheme| descripyion|position|
|------|------|------|----|
| 1. | normal flow | Every block-level element appears on a new line. |static|
| 2. | relative positioning | This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow. |relative|
| 3. | and absolute positioning | This positions the element in relation to its containing element. |absolute|

**overlapping Elements** : z-index

**Floating Elements**
float

**Clearing Floats**
clear

### Layout Grids
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

### CSS frameworks
aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
