## Events
HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

>An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

* An HTML web page has finished loading
* An HTML input field was changed
* An HTML button was clicked

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

Here is a list of some common HTML events:

|Event|	Description|
|-----|-----|
|onchange	| An HTML element has been changed|
|onclick|	The user clicks an HTML element|
|onmouseover|	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element|
|onmouseout|	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element|
|onkeydown	|The user pushes a keyboard key|
|onload	|The browser has finished loading the page|
