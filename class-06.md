#  Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

###  Problem Domain:
**Problem domain (or problem space) is an engineering term referring to all information that defines the problem and constrains the solution (the constraints being part of the problem).**
There are many common answers to this question:

* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable

*Why problem domains are hard?*
> because you canâ€™t really see what you are trying to build very clearly.  

* The more and more I write code, the more I learn that understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation.

*What can you do about it?*
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

1. Make the problem domain easier
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain
