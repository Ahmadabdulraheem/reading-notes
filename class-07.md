# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain
>**Domain Modeling**
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

*  the constructor function is defined using a function expression.

This is object-oriented programming in JavaScript at its most fundamental level.

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

>**Generate random numbers**
To model the random nature of user behavior, you'll need the help of a random number generator. Fortunately, the JavaScript standard library includes a Math.random() function for just this sort of occasion.

## Tables
What's a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

\<table>
The \<table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
\<tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening \<tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
\<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing \</tr> tag.
\<td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing \</td> tag.

 ## Functions, Methods, and Objects
 >WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

  >VARIABLE SCOPE
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.
1. Local variables
2.Global variables
  

 >WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
  Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.
  
  * properties
  * methods
